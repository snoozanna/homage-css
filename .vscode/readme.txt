Hello

There are a few things I didn't get round to that I can come back to later. Have listed them below so you know I'm aware.

General
Parallax - nearly got there with position sticky but didn’t quite manage it, will have to come back to it later. I think it would mean me having to change the grid layout on the main-content section which I can do but just ran out of time.

Not sure if should have put all text as <a>

Clean up naming of classes - its a bit all over the place

Assets
Need to do image clean up - add alts and clean up image titles. 
Put them in an img folder and reroute all hrefs. 
Add more source options for imgs and videos. 

Header
Centre ‘search for something’. Can't work out how??

Newsletter section
Need to make sure the background stays responsive

Footer 
Work out how to just have one address element - currently I have two and one displays depending on the screen size. I couldn't work out how to just have one without it affecting the flexbox....

Add winking logo svg animation

thank you!
